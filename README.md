# Mortality-Rate-Predecition

Mortality Predictions in ICU using ANN
Patients admitted to the ICU suffer from critical illness or injury and are at high risk of dying. ICU mortality rates differ widely depending on the underlying disease process, with death rates as low as 1 in 20 for patients admitted following elective surgery, and as high as 1 in 4 for patients with respiratory diseases. The risk of death can be approximated by evaluating the severity of a patientâ€™s illness as determined by important physiologic, clinical, and demographic determinants.
